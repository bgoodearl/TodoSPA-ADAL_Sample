# Registering Web App with Azure Active Directory

Because this app is using the v1 endpoint and ADAL, (c. July 2019)
we're using "App registrations (Legacy)" in the Azure Portal.<br/>
[App registrations (Legacy) c. July 2019](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RegisteredApps)

And we need register multiple apps - one for the Angular web app and one for (each??) Web API.

1. Click **New application registration**
